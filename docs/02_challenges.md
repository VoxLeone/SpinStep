# Challenges

Spherical 3D graph structures are generally more computationally intensive than their 2D counterparts, for a few key reasons:


## 1. Dimensionality Explosion


+ 2D trees typically use (x, y) positions, which are simpler to calculate, store, and traverse.

+ In 3D, you deal with (x, y, z) coordinates, plus angular orientation, which increases:

+ Node placement complexity

+ Distance computations

+ Memory usage

+ Visualization and rendering cost


## 2. Traversal Complexity


+ In 2D trees (like binary or quad trees), traversal follows simple patterns (e.g., left/right or cardinal directions).

+ In 3D graphs, especially on spherical surfaces:

+ You need spherical distance metrics (like geodesic distance)

+ Traversal across layers or around a sphere involves quaternion math or rotation matrices, which are costlier than 2D vectors
  

## 3. Connectivity


+ A 2D tree may have a fixed number of children (e.g., binary tree â†’ 2)

+ In this structure Nodes may connect to many others (radially, tangentially, across layers

+ That increases the number of edges per node and therefore processing time for algorithms like search, pathfinding, or rendering


## 4. Rendering Overhead


+ 3D visualization requires more from the GPU/CPU:

+ Perspective transforms

+ Depth sorting

+ Lighting/shading (if applied)

+ Interactive navigation (rotation, zoom, pan)

That said, with modern hardware and good algorithms, moderately sized spherical graphs (hundreds to a few thousand nodes) are very manageable.
